<p>I booked my haircut today haircut while I was at school, which feels like the kind of detail that matters more than it should. Sitting there half listening, half scrolling, thinking about literally anything else, and then deciding yeah, actually, I’ll do that. The appointment first, then the follow up decision to get it redyed. Not after careful thought. Just one random decision. Tbh it was way more interesting than Irish History.</p>

<p>When it was done and I finally saw it properly, it was redder than I expected. Not subtly red. Properly, pretty intensly red. The kind of colour that announces itself before you do. It didn’t change anything important, but felt like the volume had been nudged up a notch.</p>

<p>Somewhere in all of that I started thinking about words, which is usually how my brain behaves when it’s meant to be thinking about anything else. Specifically the difference between dyed and died. On the page they’re miles apart. One is cosmetic. The other is catastrophic. Spoken aloud though, they’re identical. And yet no one ever seems confused.</p>

<p>That’s the bit that got me. Meaning doesn’t live in spelling. It lives in context. We understand each other not because language is precise, but because it’s general enough to pass on the message. The surrounding words do the heavy lifting. Tone, situation, expectation. Writing likes to pretend it’s in charge, but speech got there first (plus spelling was only set like 150 years ago).</p>

<p>Once you notice that, contractions feel less like laziness and more like an inevitability. Should not have was never going to survive intact. Of course it broke down into shouldn’t’ve. That’s just language shrinking itself down so it fits in the mouth. We say these things effortlessly and then panic when we see them written out, apostrophes everywhere all over the place.</p>

<p>Somewhere along the way I remembered that goodbye is just God be with ye after centuries of slow erosion, which feels both funny and slightly unsettling. A blessing compressed into a casual farewell. Something long winded and religous worn secular and smooth through use. No one mourned the loss because the function stayed the same.</p>

<p>I ended up doing some digital design this evening night, working on a pylon photo I’d been sitting on for a while. Pulling it apart, layering it, messing with the colour grading until it stopped being just a hunk of metal. Lines crossing lines. Structure buried under noise and layers of frutiger.</p>

<p>It felt less like adding things and more like deciding what to keep. Editing instead of adding. Compressing instead of expanding. Letting something dense say what it needs to say without explaining itself.</p>

<p>That idea kept echoing later when I put on Understanding a Car Crash by Thursday. It’s not background music. It’s the kind of album that leans forward and expects you to do the same. Everything feels tightly packed. Emotion, noise, urgency. Nothing stretched longer than it needs to be.</p>

<p>It felt right for a day like this. Short decisions made quickly. Words shortened until they still work. A colour louder than expected. Everything slightly condensed, but somehow saying more despite it.</p>
