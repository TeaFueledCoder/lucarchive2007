<p>To all 6 of you who may like this blog - I do it basically just for me :p</p>

![To all 6 of you](/assets/images/post1/6wholike.jpg){: .accent }

<p> My favourite song of today: <strong>"Can't Smile" by Vex Red</strong>. Released 2002 off the album: Start with a Strong and Persistent Desire. I really fw the mix of nu-metal riffs and electronic mixing. I also loved the build up around toking and smoking. Had this album on while constructing this blog.</p>

<p>At somepoint between alternating from losing my mind debugging Jekyll layouts and watching Trailer Park Boys, I found my inner Bubbles and managed to figure it out</p>
